JAMRouter:  JACK <-> ALSA MIDI Router v0.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAMRouter is the best thing since sliced bread for routing MIDI events
to/from JACK MIDI software ports and MIDI hardware supported by ALSA Raw
MIDI, ALSA Sequencer, Generic Raw MIDI, and OSS MIDI.  At its core,
JAMRouter is a near-sample-accurate low-latency low-jitter MIDI event
router and translator, designed specifically with external hardware in
mind, with an initial emphasis on providing full MIDI support and SysEx
translation for the Roland Juno-106, and otherwise full compatibility
with practically all MIDI hardware.  JAMRouter is a "must have" for any
Linux MIDI musician using external MIDI hardware of any kind, especially
analog synthesizers.  With the right hardware and a properly tuned
linux-rt (realtime) kernel, near-sample-accurate over-the-wire MIDI
communication with latencies under 5 milliseconds and jitter under 150
microseconds is fully realizable.  JAMRouter has already passed dozens of
sample-accurate test results, and the timing continues to improve as
development continues.  JACK has been in the box too long.  Now JACK can
reliably communicate with MIDI hardware outside the box.  For Juno-106
owners in particular, JAMRouter could very well be reason for switching
to Linux!

JAMRouter is design driven, feature driven, and incredibly stable.  More
than just a MIDI router, JAMRouter comes with many options for
translating MIDI events in real-time, fixing most of the common and
several not so common MIDI protocol level communication incompatibilities
between outboard MIDI gear and JACK MIDI based software.  Beyond that,
JAMRouter comes with a few creative- minded MIDI event translation
features with optional echo of these translations back to the JACK MIDI
output port for sequencer recording, making it a very unique and valuable
synth programming tool, with or without external MIDI gear.

For most professional over-the-wire MIDI workloads on Linux, JAMRouter
can already serve as a complete replacement for a2jmidid, a2jmidi_bridge,
and j2amidi_bridge.  To be quite fair, these excellent tools still have
their place.  The dbus support makes them better suited for general
desktop integration, for one.  Their code is extremely stable and no
doubt the cleanest example in plain C showing how to properly implement
the JACK MIDI and ALSA Sequencer interfaces with the least amount of
hassle.  While the sub-jack-buffer-period MIDI timing accuracy of
a2jmidid has improved greatly over the years and is now good enough for a
lot of people's needs, a2jmidid's timing is still dependent on the
accuracy of the ALSA Sequencer direct interface (which at least does
bypass most of the overhead of the sequencer queue, but still incurs more
overhead than ALSA Raw MIDI, with some code paths leading to extreme
jitter corner cases).  In older versions of JACK, the accuracy of
jack_frame_time() appeared to introduce jitter dependent on JACK wakeup
times and/or system load.  This problem appears to have been solved quite
elegantly in the newer DLL timing equipped versions of JACK.  Development
on a new JACK DLL based timing solution is currently under way, however
JAMRouter will continue to support its own PLL based timing approach so
as to remain flexible with other audio and MIDI backends in the future.

Bypassing both the ALSA Sequencer queue and any dependence on timing
information obtained from older implementations of jack_frame_time() with
the combination of the ALSA Raw MIDI interface and an internal PLL driven
audio/MIDI period clock proved to be a successful combination toward
accurate over-the-wire MIDI timing in the latest PHASEX development (even
if other aspects of the realtime implementation turned out to be somewhat
flawed and still need to be fixed).  JAMRouter is essentially the MIDI
transport and timing layer pulled out of PHASEX, fully re-engineered for
rock-solid real-time performance, with Rx and Tx fully implemented for
all drivers, and fine-tuned from there.  As JAMRouter focuses on use with
ALSA Raw MIDI, (which unlike ALSA Sequencer performs no event
processing), active event processing becomes an absolute necessity for
maintaining the widest degree of compatibility between JACK MIDI software
and outboard MIDI gear.

For these reasons, JAMRouter no doubt has a slightly different target
audience than a2jmidid:  Musicians and studio professionals who need
reliable timing accurate communication between outboard MIDI gear and
JACK applications, and electronic musicians working with JACK enabled
sequencers looking for new MIDI sequencing techniques.

If a2jmidid and family work perfectly for your workload, there may be no
reason to switch.  Whether you currently use a2jmidid or not, you may
want to seriously consider JAMRouter if you:

- work with an electronic music style where timing is everything.

- are looking to add real-time event translation to your bag of synth
    programming tricks,

- are looking for solutions for keyboard controllers leaving hung notes
    in soft-synths and sequencers due to lack of Note-On/Off,
    Active-Sensing or All-Notes-Off processing,

- use MIDI gear with slow MIDI Rx interfaces that need MIDI Tx bandwidth
    regulation on the computer interface end,

- happen to own early MIDI / pre-MIDI gear that uses 1- or 2-byte
    End-SysEx sequences other than the default 0xF7,

- have any sort of need to view the real-time MIDI stream with MIDI event
    and JACK wake-up timing information,

- or if you are the proud owner of a Juno-106.

For timing performance, JAMRouter focuses on use with the ALSA Raw MIDI
and Generic Raw MIDI drivers.  ALSA Sequencer direct and OSS support are
included so that practically any MIDI interface device ever supported in
Linux can be routed to JACK MIDI ports with the best possible performance
available for that particular hardware.  No more games of wrong driver
support for MIDI interfaces getting in the way of interfacing with modern
JACK MIDI based software.

For JAMRouter/a2jmidid jitter/latency testing results obtained from
jack_midi_latency_test with JACK running at 96000 sample rate and audio
buffer periods ranging from 64 to 2048, look in doc/latency-tests/.  Full
testing rounds were conducted with JAMRouter-0.1.9 and two different PCI
based MPU-401 MIDI interfaces, a Creative SB-Live (EMU10K1 chip-set) and
an M-Audio Delta-1010 (ICE1712 chip-set).  All tests were performed with
a standard Din-5 MIDI cable connecting the interface's output to its
input.  Current benchmarks are more than promising, as they show no
real-time synchronization errors in over 100,000,000 events at default
phase lock and latency settings across all buffer period sizes from 16 to
2048.  JAMRouter's timing is rock-solid, with plenty of jitter-latency
plots to prove it.  The included test results reflect the _highest_ peak
jitter for each set of test parameters over the course of 12 hours, and
thus should serve as an accurate indication of what can be expected on
other systems.  Similar results should be obtainable from many modern
(and some very old) PCI based MIDI interfaces, especially interrupt
driven MPU-401 variants and dual Rx/Tx UART variants.  Latency testing
scripts are included with the JAMRouter source code in the latency-tests/
directory.  For more information, see the LATENCY-JITTER TESTING section
below.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAVEATS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- YMMV.  Great MIDI performance is dependent on thousands of technical
  factors.  Commercial MIDI hardware varies widely in terms of buffer
  sizes, latency, jitter, duplex performance, transmission rate, maximum
  dependable receive rate, voltage, impedance, transmission noise,
  harmonic distortion, pulse width, bit transmission frequency, byte
  transmission frequency, MIDI spec implementation, etc.

- A realtime (-rt) Linux kernel is a strict requirement for professional
  audio and MIDI in the Linux world.  Thankfully, packages are available
  through alternate repositories for many Linux distributions providing
  linux-rt kernels, rtirq, and other system tuning tools.  Please
  research what is appropriate for your specific distribution and
  hardware if you haven't already.  Once you switch to -rt, you'll never
  go back to a vanilla kernel again!  JAMRouter is designed as a realtime
  application, and absolutely no performance guarantees can be made for
  use under a non-rt kernel.  (No performance guarantees can be made for
  GPL'ed software anyway, but that's a different point.)  That being
  said, whether running on a vanilla or -rt kernel, the system will need
  to be configured so that all audio and MIDI software is allowed to run
  at realtime priorities.

- USB MIDI devices traditionally lack the ability for sub-buffer-period
  MIDI event scheduling, and thus will exhibit levels of jitter equal to
  or greater than the audio buffer latency.  The MIDI-over-USB standard
  lacks the event timestamping found in other MIDI transport systems such
  as MIDI-over-firewire.  Most USB MIDI devices internally deliver
  unscheduled MIDI events once per buffer processing period for both
  Din-5 Tx and USB output.  USB latency adds a minimum of 1 msec to both
  Rx and Tx latency, and this latency is never guaranteed to be
  consistent, and for some devices, can be an additional source of
  jitter.  For these reasons, any USB device making use of only the
  generic MIDI-over-USB standard cannot and will not ever be capable of
  delivering accurate MIDI timing.  Some USB devices are capable of
  sub-buffer-period event scheduling given the proper drivers.  Drivers
  enabling proprietary features on some of these devices simply do not
  exist for Linux.

- Flawless MIDI Rx with the the M-Audio Delta-1010 is impossible with the
  current ALSA driver.  The device appears to have some data bits encoded
  into one end of it's Rx buffer memory, possibly a proprietary hardware
  acceleration for MIDI realtime message processing, or else just an end
  of buffer marker that somehow makes its way into the serial encoder.
  Without better documentation for the device's proprietary MPU-401
  command set (specifically, methods of changing the MIDI Rx/Tx buffer
  address and/or size, and working with proprietary MPU-401 hardware
  optimizations), it is highly likely that the Linux driver will never be
  fixed.  Even if the driver was fixed, poor isolation between audio and
  MIDI electronics make this device a poor choice for recording audio in
  conjunction with any sort of MIDI input, as the electrical pulses of
  the incoming MIDI messages can be heard as a constant click or thump
  across all of the audio inputs.  Without having opened the device in
  years, suspect causes are improper connection of shield ground,
  improper connection of signal ground to audio ground and/or logic
  ground, or lack of opto-isolator on the Rx signal-ground loop, (or any
  combination of the three).  On the other hand, Tx on the Delta-1010 is
  great, as its internally generated MIDI signaling does not seem to
  interfere with the audio path in the way Rx from other devices does.
  Tx timing is as close to sample-accurate as one could ever hope for
  with such commercial hardware.

- Active Sensing support in its current form is untested.  The logic is
  for all practical purposes identical to the working Active Sensing
  implementation in PHASEX, so it should still work.  YMMV.

- Timing using the ALSA Sequencer interface is not as accurate as timing
  using any of the raw drivers (ALSA Raw MIDI, OSS MIDI, and Generic Raw
  MIDI), due to extra latencies in alsa-lib and the ALSA kernel drivers
  that cannot be predicted by JAMRouter.  Avoid use of the ALSA Sequencer
  driver when used in conjunction real MIDI hardware at buffer periods
  below 4-5 milliseconds (128 and below at 44100, or 256 and below at
  96000), as this appears to be the threshold at which the realtime
  synchronization of the buffering from the Raw MIDI device to the ALSA
  Sequencer direct capture queue begins to break down and events are
  delayed in the buffer.  Use of the ALSA Sequencer driver with software
  Seq ports and/or at buffer periods larger than 5 milliseconds, however,
  works well.  Any device with ALSA Sequencer support should also be
  supported by ALSA Raw MIDI, so this limitation should present no
  barrier to working with MIDI hardware.  For the best performance with
  MIDI hardware, please use the ALSA Raw MIDI or Generic Raw MIDI
  drivers.

- The OSS sequencer interface is incomplete at best and use of
  JAMRouter's 'oss' and 'oss2' is disabled by default.  Development for
  the OSS /dev/sequencer and /dev/sequencer2 (/dev/music) device
  implementations will likely not continue.  Use the 'generic' driver
  with the OSS supplied /dev/midiNN interfaces instead.  This code has
  has only been tested in its current form with ALSA's OSS emulation
  support, and not with actual OSS in-kernel drivers installed.  YMMV.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOALS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Reliability:

    Whether playing music on stage, working in the studio, or writing
    music on a laptop in a coffee shop, the instruments and tools need to
    function properly and consistently in order to achieve good results.
    Musicians need to be able to focus on the music, not shortcomings of
    the tool-set.  JAMRouter has been thoroughly tested and bench-marked
    for provable timing accuracy with no synchronization errors in over
    100,000,000 events at default settings with the ALSA Raw MIDI driver.
    Rx and Tx latency selection at all buffer sizes (16 to 2048) includes
    minimum latency calculation to safeguard against synchronization
    errors.  Additional safeguards prevent thread synchronization errors
    at low buffer sizes.  Jitter is practically the same across all
    buffer sizes.

* Compatibility:

    JAMRouter aims for full MIDI compatibility with all hardware devices
    and JACK MIDI applications that properly support the MIDI 1.0
    standard.  Beyond supporting the standard, JAMRouter also aims to be
    fully tolerant of devices and software that break the standard at the
    MIDI protocol level or that use the MIDI spec in unexpected ways.

* Stage Friendly:

    Low MIDI latency and low timing jitter.  No GUI or dependence on a
    mouse.  Scriptable.  Perfect for rack-mount MIDI router or sound
    module applications.  Near-sample-accurate timing for over-the-wire
    MIDI performances.  Command line options are saved in LASH project or
    JACK session.  Colorful MIDI stream and MIDI timing debug output are
    suitable for performance visuals (given a terminal with fast smooth
    scrolling video output).  With decent hardware running JAMRouter and
    a recent linux-rt kernel with proper permissions, priority tuning,
    audio buffer tuning, hardware tuning (BIOS settings, PCI latencies,
    etc.), MIDI event latencies of under 10ms with timing jitter of under
    300us should be well within reach for most commercial audio hardware,
    and latencies of under 5ms and jitter under 150us should be available
    from most modern PCI MPU-401 based MIDI hardware.  Default latency
    settings and slightly more aggressive latency settings have been
    rigorously tested at all buffer size / sample rate settings for
    dependable rock-solid timing accuracy.

* Studio Friendly:

    Focus on work-flow.  The recent development work has been aimed at
    making JAMRouter easy to use and efficient to manage using LASH or
    JACK session management.  Again, the focus should be on the music,
    not on remembering how to make the tools jump through a bunch of
    hoops just to do their job.  Save the session, and know that the
    exact same settings will be used the next time.  JAMRouter
    development will continue in this direction with new features based
    on community feedback.  The default MIDI device tuning settings
    should work well under most circumstances.  JAMRouter takes the
    approach of turning the features on as you need them.  For solving
    nearly all of the common show-stopping MIDI protocol communication
    problems with outboard MIDI gear, all the right MIDI event
    translation options are provided.

* Perfect Timing:

    Or as perfect as possible with the selected MIDI hardware.  JACK MIDI
    has perfect sample-accurate timing by design.  The ALSA sequencer
    interface implements event timestamping, but a lot of software either
    ignores or sidesteps this part of the API, most often resulting in
    MIDI timing quantized to interval of the audio buffer period.  This
    quantization of anywhere from 1.3ms to 23.2ms or more translates into
    timing jitter.  This jitter has traditionally made over-the-wire MIDI
    under Linux unreliable for serious musical work with intricate
    timing, especially at buffer sizes greater than 256.  For Linux MIDI
    musicians working out of a sequencer, latency generally isn't an
    issue just as long as it is consistent.  Unfortunately, increasing
    latency for better system stability and guard against audio buffer
    underruns has traditionally increased MIDI timing jitter by the same
    amount.  JAMRouter fully addresses these timing issues by generating
    its own internal clock for timestamping received MIDI events and
    scheduling event transmission, almost completely eliminating the
    application imposed audio buffer period quantization jitter and
    providing nearly the same jitter performance across all buffer sizes.
    JAMRouter has already produced dozens of sample-accurate
    latency-jitter testing runs each of 1024 MIDI events or greater with
    the M-Audio Delta-1010.  Timing will continue to improve as JAMRouter
    development continues.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Native MIDI Support:

    JAMRouter supports all native Linux MIDI drivers and provides a full
    2-way bridge between JACK MIDI ports and any ALSA Sequencer, ALSA Raw
    MIDI, Generic Raw MIDI, or OSS Raw MIDI supported devices and ports.
    If a MIDI device has any sort of Linux driver support, there is no
    doubt that it will work with JAMRouter.

* Realtime MIDI Clock:

    Addresses the issue of how to accurately synchronize MIDI events with
    individual frame positions within a buffer period instead of
    quantizing the timing to whatever the audio buffer period happens to
    be.  Typical audio hardware supports stable realtime operation at
    anywhere from 1.3 - 23.2 milliseconds latency.  With no additional
    synchronization, this audio latency becomes a self-imposed
    quantization factor on event timing, adding MIDI timing jitter
    roughly equal to the duration of one audio buffer processing period
    (or even double that with some poorly designed hardware or drivers),
    hence the need for an internal MIDI clock.

    JAMRouter features a lock-free PLL driven audio / MIDI timing
    synchronization system.  The PLL latches onto the audio buffer
    processing periods and generates a high-precision MIDI clock
    reference, with much less jitter than timing based on when the audio
    processing cycle actually wakes up (which can really be anywhere
    within the period).  This clock design is agnostic to the specific
    audio and MIDI drivers being used and requires no timer interrupts
    other than the system timers involved in clock_nanosleep().  The most
    recent JAMRouter development has focused on better interaction with
    JACK's new DLL timing system by latching on to the DLL generated
    cycle start time instead of the process callback time.  In essence,
    the timing accuracy achieved is only dependent on the MIDI hardware /
    software and realtime scheduling latencies of the system.  With
    decent consumer and professional MIDI hardware, sub-millisecond
    timing accuracy is available with total MIDI event latency under 5ms,
    accurate and responsive enough for most professional sound engineers
    and musicians.  Some on-board and PCI based gameport I/O MPU-401
    interfaces are capable of sustaining for days on end combined Rx+Tx
    latency of less than 4 milliseconds and combined Rx+Tx jitter of well
    under 150 microseconds.  Current benchmarks for all buffer period
    sizes from 16 to 2048 all show at most 4 frames jitter at 44100, and
    9 frames jitter at 96000 with the Raw MIDI drivers, meeting or
    exceeding the specs advertised by some hardware vendors.

    JAMRouter uses separate threads with realtime scheduling for JACK,
    MIDI Rx, and MIDI Tx.  Threads receive all synchronization info
    through a realtime-safe lock-free ringbuffer, with a few extra bits
    of logic to detect and correct for realtime CPU cache latency misses.
    When timing checks performed by the MIDI Rx/Tx threads detect stale
    timing synchronization (usually CPU cache latency issues), the timing
    calculations are performed based on the last updated synchronization
    data, with the only difference in the end result being that the
    decayed average clock interval is not updated for a single buffer
    processing period, amounting to a timestamping or scheduling
    difference of a single frame at most.  This strategy allows for
    flawless time synchronization even at extremely low buffer sizes.

* Running-Status Support:

    JAMRouter properly restores the Running-Status byte when routing
    messages to JACK MIDI, and optionally saves MIDI Tx bandwidth by
    omitting the Running-Status byte sent over the wire whenever
    possible.

* Note-On/Off Tracking Support:

    Even without a synth engine or any kind of sound module, JAMRouter
    actively tracks Note-On and Note-Off messages, with proper support
    for the All-Notes-Off controller.  Most Linux sequencers support only
    the more common method of turning notes off by sending Note-On
    messages with a Velocity of 0, and do not actually support Note-Off
    messages or the All-Notes-Off controller, resulting in hung notes
    recorded into a sequencer or played through a software synth.
    JAMRouter solves this problem by converting all Note-Off messages
    into Note-On-Velocity-0 messages, and by using the note tracking to
    generate these messages whenever an All-Notes-Off controller message
    is received.

* Active-Sensing Support:

    Traditionally, synth controllers that send Active Sensing messages
    have been problematic in the Linux MIDI world.  Most software simply
    does not support this part of the MIDI spec, and will either ignore
    or drop Active Sensing messages.  For some devices, the only problem
    this creates is the sounding of hung notes when the MIDI cable is
    unplugged.  Some synth controllers, however, are designed save MIDI
    bandwidth by omitting all note-off messages that coincide with the
    current 300ms Active Sensing timeout, with no way to turn active
    sensing off, making Active Sensing support on the other end an
    absolute necessity (old Roland stage pianos come to mind).  JAMRouter
    is equipped with 3 Active Sensing modes: "on" to properly set the
    Active Sensing timeout and utilize note on/off tracking for sending
    Note-Off (actually Note-On-Velocity-0) messages for all notes in play
    in the case of an Active Sensing timeout, "thru" to simply pass the
    Active Sensing messages through with no special handling, and "drop"
    to quietly discard all Active Sensing messages.

* Note to Pitchbend Translation:

    When enabled, notes received on a selected channel are translated to
    Pitchbend messages on the same or alternate channel.  Center note and
    range in half-steps for Pitchbend tracking can be specified on the
    command line.  Now, pitchbend movements can be generated to play the
    pitchbender perfectly in tune.  No more guessing.

* Note to Controller Translation:

    When enabled, notes received on a selected channel are translated to
    Controller messages on the same or alternate channel.  Unlock some of
    the true secrets of synthesizer programming over MIDI.  Get results
    that most people have to modify their gear to obtain.

* Pitchbend to Controller Translation:

    When enabled, Pitchbend messages received on a selected channel are
    translated to Controller messages on the same or alternate channel.
    As the Pitchbender is a 14bit parameter, the MSB is used as the 7bit
    Controller value, and the LSB is discarded.

* Translation Echo:

    When enabled, all Pitchbend and Controller translations are echoed to
    the JACK MIDI output port for sequencer recording.

* Juno-106 SysEx Translation:

    When enabled, adds complete support for the Juno-106.  All SysEx
    messages received from the Juno-106 are translated into Controller
    messages before being queued for the JACK MIDI output port, including
    both patch dumps and controller changes.  The two bit-packed SysEx
    controllers for the binary button and switch states are further
    translated into independent Controllers for each button and switch.
    All Controller messages received on the JACK MIDI input port are
    translated back into SysEx messages before being transmitted back to
    the Juno-106.  Binary state of all buttons and switches is tracked by
    JAMRouter, allowing button and switch changes to be sequenced fully
    independently.  See doc/juno-106.txt for full implementation details.

* SysEx Translation Echo:

    When enabled, all Pitchbend and Controller messages translated into
    Juno-106 SysEx are echoed back to the JACK MIDI output port for
    sequencer recording.  This allows for recording and saving Juno-106
    SysEx while programming the Juno-106 with standard MIDI Controllers.

* Non-Standard End-SysEx Byte Translation:

    Some pre- MIDI-1.0 devices may send SysEx messages not terminated
    with the standard byte value of 0xF7.  JAMRouter provides options to
    specify an alternate terminating byte value, with an optional 2nd
    terminator byte value to support any one or two byte End-SysEx
    markers.

* MIDI Bandwidth Optimization:

    JAMRouter does what it can to dependably optimize MIDI bandwidth.
    Beyond the single byte-per-message savings with the optional use of
    Running Status, JAMRouter also removes duplicate Note-Off messages
    and condenses multiple messages queued for the same Controller at the
    same time into a single Controller message.  Optionally, any Note-Off
    messages for all remaining keys in play can be translated into a
    single All-Notes-Off Controller message, as is done by many synth
    controllers.  In Juno-106 mode, multiple SysEx messages queued for
    the same parameter at the same time are reduced to a single SysEx
    message, allowing independent sequencing of multiple button states to
    be recombined into a single SysEx parameter message.  This
    combination of bandwidth saving features and the visual MIDI stream
    and timing debug allow MIDI streams with intricate programming to be
    fine-tuned so that notes sound as close to when they should sound as
    possible given the current amount of MIDI bandwidth.

* MIDI Bandwidth Regulation:

    Optional guard time between transmission of MIDI bytes can be
    specified for any Raw MIDI devices.  Optional guard time between
    transmission of events may be specified both for Raw devices and ALSA
    Sequencer ports.  With some MIDI interface / outboard MIDI gear
    combinations, one or both of these options may be necessary for
    reliable transmission when MIDI bandwidth becomes congested,
    especially with large SysEx dumps, SysEx operating system loads, etc.
    Some outboard MIDI gear and interface devices are known for
    unreliable communication at full MIDI bandwidth.  Many more devices
    are known for requiring slightly slower transmission speeds for
    reliable OS loads through MIDI SysEx.

* MIDI Stream Debug Output:

    MIDI stream debug outputs each of the MIDI Rx/Tx and Jack
    Input/Output ports in different colors for instant identification.
    Timing debug adds color coded frame number for JACK wake-up time
    positioning within the current MIDI clock period, along with
    indicators for half-frame jitter adjustments to the clock period, and
    timing information for every MIDI event.  Transmit timing debug adds
    color-coded timing indicators for when the MIDI Tx thread sleeps and
    updates its index into the MIDI event queue.  JAMRouter's full
    (stream + timing) debug output allows all sorts of information in
    regards to the live MIDI stream to be gleaned in one glance.  All
    debug output is sent to a realtime-safe queue and processed by a
    lower priority debug thread.  The performance impact on MIDI timing
    of leaving the debug code enabled, if any, is negligible.

* Hassle Free Session Management:

    When saving JACK sessions, all running instances of JAMRouter,
    each with their unique settings exactly as entered on the command
    line, will be recalled with the same arguments and auto-connect on
    both the JACK side and ALSA side to the exact same state they were in
    when the session was saved.  With JACK session, keeping track of the
    command line arguments for the MIDI routings of each project really
    does become hassle free.  Set it and forget it.  On session load,
    each instance of JAMRouter will be started in its own terminal.  The
    same session management functionality is also available through LASH
    (with the current limitation of running headless).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE TUNING GUIDELINES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Driver Selection:

    For the best MIDI timing with low-latency and low-jitter, try the
    Generic Raw MIDI driver first (-M generic -D /dev/midi?), followed by
    the ALSA Raw MIDI driver (-M raw -D hw:?,?), followed by the OSS
    support with the generic MIDI driver (-M generic -D /dev/midi??),
    and as a last resort, the ALSA Sequencer driver (-M seq -D ??:?).
    For many devices, the performance under ALSA Raw MIDI, Generic Raw
    MIDI, and OSS MIDI will be nearly identical.  While the ALSA
    Sequencer driver is implemented with snd_seq_event_output_direct()
    (thus bypassing the ALSA Sequencer queue), use of the ALSA Sequencer
    driver in JAMRouter incurs more overhead in alsa-lib and in the
    kernel device drivers, and will exhibit far more jitter than any of
    the raw drivers (which is still far less jitter than what is provided
    by a2jmidid).  Use of the ALSA Sequencer driver with MIDI hardware at
    latencies under 5ms is not recommended.

* Phase Lock (-z):

    The default MIDI period phase lock is 0.5, meaning that the start and
    end of each MIDI timing period is calculated so that the JACK buffer
    processing thread is expected to wake up and begin its work half way
    through the calculated MIDI period.  Increasing the phase lock will
    increase Rx latency while decreasing Tx latency by the same amount,
    and vice versa.  The phase lock affects the timing of synchronizing
    data between threads very directly, so it is important to note that
    at single period Rx and Tx latencies, when the MIDI and JACK phases
    are brought closer together than time in which the CPU-cache can
    reliably deliver the contents of the lock-free sync_info[] and MIDI
    event queue ringbuffers, JAMRouter will automatically increase Rx or
    Tx latency by one full period to compensate as a safeguard against
    synchronization error.  Increasing phase lock increases MIDI Rx -->
    JACK Output latency while decreasing JACK Input --> MIDI Tx latency.
    Decreasing phase lock decreases MIDI Rx --> JACK Output latency while
    increasing JACK Input --> MIDI Tx latency.  Within reasonable limits,
    the phase lock allows trading Rx for Tx latency and vice versa for
    individual use cases.  The --phase-lock (-z) option should be treated
    as an expert option.  Leaving phase lock at the default 0.5 is in
    most cases to best choice, especially at buffer sizes of 128 and
    below.  Once the integration with JACK DLL timing is complete, the
    thread phase relationships will change, and the --phase-lock option
    will likely be removed.

* Buffer Period Size:

    Audio buffer period size should be chosen according to the audio
    requirements in conjunction with the MIDI workload.  JAMRouter's
    jitter performance is nearly identical across all buffer period sizes
    from 16 to 2048 (the full range supported by JACK).

    For recording over-the-wire MIDI performances into a JACK MIDI
    sequencer, the audio processing load should be kept as light as
    possible to allow for lower buffer sizes, and thus lower latency.  At
    buffer sizes of 256 and lower, a proper MIDI recording chain
    consisting of Keyboard Controller --> PC Interface --> JAMRouter -->
    JACK MIDI Sequencer --> JAMRouter --> PC Interface --> MIDI Sound
    Module with a total keypress-to-note-on latency of less than 10
    milliseconds and total system jitter of less than 150 microseconds is
    fully realizable.  Unless the sequencer is performing any sort of
    recording quantization, this setup guarantees that the timing that is
    heard for the initial performance is essentially the same timing that
    is heard when played back from the sequencer, with the only
    difference being the difference in MIDI Tx + Sound Module Rx jitter
    from recording to playback.

    For DAW recording of sequenced synth lines through external MIDI
    gear, the audio buffer size should be kept as high as is needed to
    allow for dependable xrun free performance with the chosen audio
    workload.  JAMRouter's jitter performance is the same or even better
    at higher latencies.  Unlike recording live musicians, the task of
    recording sequenced material does not require low latencies, just
    consistent latencies (low jitter).  With JAMRouter, there is never a
    need to lower the buffer period size down to levels that do cause
    occasional (or frequent) xruns just to get more accurate MIDI timing.

    For MIDI only applications such as MIDI routers and event processors,
    much lower latencies can be realized without the audio processing
    overhead.  With the appropriate hardware supporting xrun free
    operation at buffer sizes as low as 16, it is quite possible to use
    JAMRouter to build a MIDI router / event processor with less than 2
    milliseconds total Rx+Tx MIDI event latency and less than 150
    microseconds total Rx+Tx jitter, on par with (or better than) the
    timing offered by commercially available dedicated MIDI hardware
    performing these functions.

* Tx Byte Guard Time (-g):

    The --byte-guard-time (-g) option should be used only in cases where
    the receiving device is unable to operate at full MIDI bandwidth.
    This option imposes a minimum delay between the transmission of
    successive bytes by forcing the MIDI Tx thread to sleep for the
    specified number of microseconds after writing each byte to the
    device.  Byte guard times below 320 microseconds (the time needed to
    transmit one MIDI byte at wire-speed) may be ineffective at
    regulating MIDI bandwidth, as this sleep time is imposed on
    JAMRouter's MIDI Tx thread, and not within the device driver.  Byte
    guard times of 640 microseconds (the point at which MIDI bandwidth is
    theoretically cut in half) and below are not known to interfere with
    timing accuracy.  320 to 640 should be considered the useful range of
    this option.  Please note that this option is only able to regulate
    the byte-by-byte transmission speed, and not the bit-rate of the
    interface itself (which cannot be changed with most hardware and
    drivers).

* JACK and qjackctl:

    While qjackctl provides a MIDI Driver dropdown in the Setup window,
    JACK does not support any MIDI system other than JACK MIDI.  The MIDI
    Driver option in qjackctl should invariably be set to 'none', and not
    'raw', 'seq', or 'alsa_midi'.  JAMRouter is the piece of software
    connecting to natively supported MIDI devices, not JACK.  Keeping
    this one fact in mind will help avoid the common confusion
    surrounding qjackctl's MIDI Driver option.

* Jitter Correction Mode (-j):

    JAMRouter's Rx jitter correction mode is new and still in the
    experimental stages.  For now, it includes one type of correction
    based on observed patterns with with two MPU-401 type interfaces.
    This correction simply normalizes the timespan of 2-7 byte events to
    predetermined values and consistently brings jitter testing scores
    down by 1-2 frames, and in some cases, provides occasional
    sample-accurate test runs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATENCY-JITTER TESTING:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MIDI Interface Benchmarking:

    A set of latency testing scripts utilizing jack_midi_latency_test has
    been included in latency-tests/.  All tests should be run from the
    latency-tests/ directory.  For all tests, loop the device's MIDI Out
    back to its MIDI In using a standard DIN-5 MIDI cable.

    jamrouter-latency-test:  This script will perform a single test with
    full JAMRouter stream and debug timing output followed by output of
    the test parameters and the jack_midi_latency_test results.  Run the
    script without arguments for help or edit the script to change the
    default testing parameters.  Please note that the current default
    testing latencies are slightly more aggressive than the JAMRouter
    defaults.

    run-batch:  This script will perform a numbered series of tests,
    across the ranges of hardware devices, buffer period sizes / test
    iterations, phase lock values, and byte guard time values.  These
    test ranges can be easily set at the top of the script to suit
    individual testing needs.

    analyze-test:  Run this script to view selected test debug output and
    peak jitter results similar to what is displayed by run-batch while
    the tests are running.

    analyze-full:  When analyze-test fails to show the suspect MIDI
    events responsible for timing failure, the analyze-full script will
    sort the test output based on the event frame time as originally
    scheduled by jack_midi_latency_test, allowing any timing
    irregularities to be located visually.

* Notes:

    As of JAMRouter-0.1.9, no synchronization errors have been detected
    in hundreds of tests (over 100,000,000 MIDI events in total) at default
    settings for all buffer period sizes.

    As of JAMRouter-0.2.1, the best timing performance is offered by the
    Generic Raw MIDI driver, beating out the ALSA Raw MIDI driver by an
    average of ~0.5 frames jitter.

    As of JAMRouter-0.2.1, the Delta-1010 at buffer size 1024 and
    sampling rate 48000, ~20% of the test runs of 1024 MIDI events each
    will produce perfect sample-accurate scores with jitter-control and
    JACK DLL level 1 enabled (-j -1).

Examples:

* List all ALSA Sequencer, ALSA Raw MIDI, and JACK MIDI ports/devices:

    jamrouter -l

* Connect generic /dev/midi1 device input of MusE JACK MIDI port 2:

    jamrouter -M generic -D /dev/midi1 -o MusE:jack-midi-2_in

* Make Juno-106 available to JACK on Generic Raw MIDI /dev/midi1, with
  stream and timing debug output full Juno SysEx translation.  Map all
  Note-On messages within an octave of Middle-C on channel 15 to
  Pitchbender on channel 1.  Map all Note-On messages on channel 16 to
  VCF Freq on channel 1:

    jamrouter -M generic -D /dev/midi1 -J -p 15,1,60,12 -k 16,1,19

* Ideal Juno-106 programming mode:  same as above, with the addition of
  echoing translated Pitchbend and Controller 19 messages back to the
  JACK output port, and saving MIDI bandwidth by making use of Running
  Status:

    jamrouter -M generic -D /dev/midi1 -J -p 15,1,60,12 -k 16,1,19 -e -R

  channel 1, and additionally echo these translations back to the JACK
  MIDI output for sequencer recording:

    jamrouter -M generic -D /dev/midi2 -R -k 15,1,40 -k 16,1,41 -e

* Make OSS Raw MIDI device /dev/midi02 available on JAMRouter's JACK MIDI
  input/output:

    jamrouter -M generic -D /dev/midi02

* Run jamrouter as a JACK MIDI stream and timing debugger without
  connecting to ALSA Seq, ALSA Raw MIDI, or OSS MIDI devices:

    jamrouter -M dummy -d full

* Send real Note-Off messages instead translating to Note-On-Velocity-0
  messages on both MIDI Tx and JACK MIDI output, and enable stream,
  timing, and testing debug output when measuring latency and jitter with
  jack_midi_latency_test:

    jamrouter -M raw -D hw:1,0 -F -0 -d stream -d timing -d testing


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RATIONALE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Timing is everything.  In the days of sample-accurate in-the-box
  sequencing, hardware MIDI is often considered too jitter-prone to be
  considered for serious projects.  Recording over-the-wire MIDI synth
  parts is usually very time consuming, usually requiring the same level
  of care and similar set of tricks as guitar recording to produce
  solidly timed tracks.  In many cases, both the computer's MIDI
  interface and the outboard gear's MIDI interface are capable of
  low-latency low-jitter rock-solid timing on their own, but only with
  the right combination of drivers and software.  JAMRouter is engineered
  specifically to bridge this gap, offering the best generic solution
  possible for reliable rock-solid timing-accurate communication between
  JACK MIDI applications and MIDI hardware of any kind.  For some styles
  of electronic music with intricate timing and lots of controller
  changes, JAMRouter offers Linux/ALSA/JACK the capabilities to make
  Linux a viable platform for a wide variety of professional
  over-the-wire MIDI applications, limited only by the quality and
  variety of JACK MIDI software.

* A new development bed was needed for bringing together under one roof
  all the code and functionality of the MIDI transport layers from PHASEX
  (the dark purple analog modeling beast of a synthesizer for Linux) and
  the long abandoned vsex (the Virus SysEX dump utility for Linux).  With
  JAMRouter being a very different use case for the internal MIDI queue
  and event clock than PHASEX, this became the perfect project for
  assembling what will no doubt eventually turn into a generic software
  MIDI routing library.  Development on the MIDI transport code is much
  simpler without having to look at all the PHASEX specific code.  This
  has allowed a complete overhaul of the of the MIDI transport code and
  its timing core, with rock-solid results.

* A few MIDI libraries with varying degrees of functionality exist for
  Linux, but none of them meet the specific needs of both JAMRouter and
  PHASEX in a way that makes them easy to implement in both projects.
  Other MIDI transport libraries like TSE tend to favor a rich feature
  set designed for sequencers.  The JAMRouter MIDI transport code focuses
  on the MIDI transport features needed for live performance, studio
  recording, and hardware interfacing issues associated with connecting
  hardware and software MIDI based synthesizers, controllers, and event
  processors.  The JAMRouter features could be developed much more
  quickly and accurately using a MIDI transport layer already adapted as
  an application framework (PHASEX).  Very little of the JAMRouter code
  is necessarily JAMRouter specific.  One of the goals of JAMRouter is to
  create libjam, to which both JAMRouter and PHASEX will eventually link.

* A lonely Juno-106 (OK... more like a Juno-105 with one of the wave
  generator chips half dead) only part way through its restoration, and
  needed for some synth lines on some new projects.  The Juno-106 is the
  first analog flagship model synthesizer incorporating MIDI produced by
  Roland, a true piece of living musical history.  Such a classic
  deserves JAMRouter.  Some new tunes in the works deserve the Juno-106.
  The creative side of the MIDI event translation allows Juno-106
  programming to be taken to a whole new level.  Here's a hint to
  unlocking to true secrets buried in the Juno-106 without modification:
  This synth is very well designed, and great care was taken to map the
  VCF Frequency controller values directly to the frequencies
  corresponding to the MIDI notes of the same value, a feature highly
  desired in analog and digital synths alike, but unfortunately a design
  detail completely ignored in a lot of synthesizers.

* A lonely Access Virus b, arguably the best digital analog modeling
  synth ever made, topped only by its successors.  Great reverb
  processing makes it a poor man's Lexicon.  Also has a clock generator
  and arpeggiator, very useful for stress-testing the MIDI transport in
  JAMRouter.  The Virus b was advertised as and certainly is the Swiss
  Army Knife of synthesizers.  With JAMRouter, the Virus b can take it's
  rightful place as the Swiss Army Knife of outboard gear in a Linux
  based studio.

* Along with preserving musical history by preserving and restoring early
  MIDI hardware from a massively influential era, we also need to be able
  to program this vintage MIDI gear with modern studio hardware.  Many
  synthesizers from this era require external programmer units with
  knobs, buttons, sliders, and sometimes lights and LCD displays to send
  the appropriate controller and/or SysEx data.  Roland never designed a
  patch programmer for the Juno-106.  (They did however release an
  external arpeggiator.  There are excellent arpeggiators for JACK, so an
  including an arpeggiator in JAMRouter is not on the priority list).
  SysEx only parameter control makes programming the Juno-106 in most
  sequencers a chore.  A few weeks of programming on JAMRouter will end
  up saving more than a few weeks in Juno-106 controller programming time
  this year alone.

* A lot of older synthesizers are very difficult to interface with modern
  computers due to slight deviations from the MIDI spec between the
  companies in the early years as everyone was simultaneously yet
  independently implementing a new shared specification.  Some MIDI gear
  is intolerant of deviations from the spec by other MIDI gear.  Some
  MIDI gear is expectant of its own deviations or omissions from the MIDI
  spec when interfacing with other MIDI gear.  With the exception of
  clock signal (re)generation, JAMRouter addresses every software
  addressable issue possible, and provides the MIDI event processing
  necessary to make perfect use of what would otherwise be unusable or
  undependable MIDI gear when it comes to interfacing with JACK MIDI
  applications running on Linux machines.  A few weeks of programming
  will solve more than a few weeks of engineering hassles in the studio
  this year alone, even with MIDI gear that is generally considered
  faithfully MIDI compliant through and through.

* When a professional studio engineer, a semi-professional DJ, and a
  semi-professional electronic musician were asked if they would consider
  Linux as a professional audio production platform, their replies were
  nearly identical.  All three had researched the possibility after
  seeing and hearing about the successes of Ardour, JACK, the Linux
  realtime kernel, along with the rich assortment of audio and MIDI
  software available for JACK.  When it came down to it, all three of
  these engineer-musicians decided against using Linux as a professional
  audio production platform for the same reason:  Poor out-of-the-box
  MIDI timing when using all the latest JACK MIDI software.  With a
  Juno-106 and Access Virus b sitting in storage for years for the exact
  same reason, these concerns could not be refuted at the time.  This
  has been one of the primary motivating factors in the development of
  JAMRouter.

- Embedded hardware projects, DIY projects, commercial endeavors, etc.

What do you like about JAMRouter?
What don't you like about JAMRouter?
What features do you think are missing?
What would you do differently?
What hardware and/or software do you use with JAMRouter?
What are you looking for in a UI?
What are you looking for in a MIDI transport library for Linux?
What audio session management system do you use?
Does anything prevent you from using JAMRouter dependably on stage?
Does anything preventing you from using JAMRouter dependably in the studio?

Any feedback can only influence JAMRouter (eventually libjam) development
to move in a positive direction.
